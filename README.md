# Package `GetTDData`

Information regarding prices and  yields of bonds issued by the Brazilian government can be downloaded manually as excel files from the [Tesouro Direto website](https://www.tesourodireto.com.br/). However, it can be painful to aggregate all of this data into something useful as the files don't have an uniform format and are all divided by year and asset code.

Package `GetTDData` makes the process of importing data from Tesouro direto much easier. All that you need in order to download the data is the name of the assets (LFT, LTN, NTN-C, NTN-B, NTN-B Principal, NTN-F) and the desired dates of maturity (e.g. 2016-01-01). 

# Installation

```
# from CRAN (stable version)
install.package('GetTDData')

# from github (development version)
devtools::install_github('msperlin/GetTDData')
```
